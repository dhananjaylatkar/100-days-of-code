#+TITLE: 100 Days of Code Log
#+AUTHOR: Dhananjay

* Day 1: 2021-04-24 Sat
*Today's Progress:* Learning Rust - Arrays, Vectors, Slices and Strings

*Thoughts:* Arr, Vec and Slices are similar to ~list~ in python but, Strings are very tricky.

*Link to work:* Rust Fundamentals from Pluralsight. Notes are in my [[https://github.com/dhananjaylatkar/rust-tutorial][rust-tuorial]] repo

* Day 2: 2021-04-25 Sun
*Today's Progress:* Learning Rust - Tuples, Pattern matching, Generics, Functions, Methods and Closures

*Thoughts:*
1. Getting val from tuple felt odd (~t.0~).
2. Returning from fuc is kinda confusing (not writing ~return~ and ~;~).
3. Closures are like ~arrow~ func from ~js~

* Day 3: 2021-04-26 Mon
*Today's Progress:* Learning Rust - HOF, Traits and Lifetime (Ownership and Borrowing)

*Thoughts:*
1. HOFs are functions that take one or more functions and/or produce a more useful function.
2. Lifetime helps in memory safety.
